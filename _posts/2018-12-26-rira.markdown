### They took a chance and it paid off (8/10)

These bold, daring nachos fly in the face of everything that nachos purists hold sacred. They're great. Way to go, [R√≠Ra](https://rira.com/atlanta/food-and-drink/food-menus/dinner-2/)!

Think "creamy, not cheesy". Keep thinking about it, this is complicated stuff. Okay, I'll help: imagine all the heavy handed saltiness of canned cheese sauce on a convenience store shelf - now imagine its refined, well bred cousin. _Now_ imagine that paired with a Guiness. You've gotta try these. (They're a seasonal item, so be nice to your server if they're not available.)

**The chips:** Surprisingly light and crispy - way better than chips from an Irish pub have any right to be üëç

**The cheese:** Melted jack and cheddar with a creamy sauce

**The toppings:** Grilled chicken chunks. Black beans and corn. The height of sophistication.

**The verdict:** Try to eat this dish as many times as possible before you die.
