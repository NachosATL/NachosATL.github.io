### Hearty, filling, a little too sweet (6/10)

[Publico](https://www.publicotapandkitchenatl.com/) is one of my favorite spots in Midtown. Friendly service, margaritas on tap, and a menu for dogs. What's not to love?

The Cuban Nachos with Braised Pork were thoroughly satsifying, but watch out if you're not into pineapple.

**The chips:** Crunchy and delicious

**The cheese:** Melted monterey jack

**The toppings:** The pork is tender and tasty-riffic. Generous portion of guacamole. Salsa verde is on point. ⚠️ Lots of pineapple chunks!

**The verdict:** Recommended if you have a sweet tooth
