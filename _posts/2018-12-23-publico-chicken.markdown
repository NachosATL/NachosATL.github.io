### Pure bliss! Zesty chicken + pineapple = üòã (8/10)

Ok, so this is the second [Publico](https://www.publicotapandkitchenatl.com/) on the site. You're welcome.

The Cuban Nachos with Mountain Chicken righted all the wrongs committed by the Braised Pork option. Gone was the clash of rich, roasty pork flavor with tart, acidic pineapple. 

The chicken in these nachos nuzzles up to the pineapple chunks and makes sweet culinary love to them. Like a romantic Hawaiian honeymoon scene in a weird kids' movie where fruit and chickens can talk.

**The chips:** Crunchy and delicious

**The cheese:** Melted monterey jack

**The toppings:** The chicken is slightly spicy and complements the fruity salsa and pineapple chunks perfectly. Generous portion of guacamole.

**The verdict:** Highly recommended. Margarita specials on Mondays make it even better ‚ù§Ô∏è
