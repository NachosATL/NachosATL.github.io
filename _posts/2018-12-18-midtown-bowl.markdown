### They are nachos (4/10)

Medical practitioners refer to it as Nacho Blindness™ - when the very presence of nachos on a menu causes the sufferer to be oblivious to what are clearly better options.

[Midtown Bowl](https://midtownbowl.com/food-drinks-menu/) is a great place to bowl and they have a thing called The Big Nasty; clearly this is what you're meant to order with your pitcher of beer and stylish shoe rental. Try that instead and have fun!

**The chips:** Pretty good! Crispy and fresh-tasting

**The cheese:** A plastic ramekin of nacho cheese sauce

**The toppings:** Points for the DIY options here. I went for jalapeños, salsa, sour cream, and cheese sauce.

**The verdict:** Just order The Big Nasty, you freak you.
